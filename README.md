This project is a **Spotify clone** that I built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It replicates the front-end interface of the popular music streaming platform, focusing on responsive design, layout, and styling.

🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the layout looks great on different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: A flexible navigation bar with hover effects.
- **Music Player**: A sticky music player that mimics the functionality of the actual Spotify player, including controls for play, pause, and volume adjustment.
- **Cards & Grids**: Dynamic display of album cards with hover animations.
- **Dark Mode Styling**: Modern, sleek dark interface inspired by the original Spotify design.

🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout, including custom hover effects, transitions, and responsive design using media queries.

🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project was to improve my front-end development skills by recreating a well-known interface. It helped me focus on:

- Practicing flexbox and grid layout systems.
- Managing hover effects and transitions.
- Building a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
